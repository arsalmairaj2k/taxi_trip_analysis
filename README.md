# 🚀 Machine Learning Model Optimization: A Complete Pipeline

## 📌 Overview
This project explores a complete machine learning pipeline, from **data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to **model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and final evaluation**. We leverage various regression models, optimize them using **GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV**, and analyze their performance with key metrics.

## 📊 Key Highlights
- **Dataset Preparation:** Handling missing values, outliers, categorical, and text attributes.
- **Stratified Sampling:** Ensuring balanced dataset representation.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Comparing Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing models for better accuracy.
- **Final Selection:** Choosing the best model based on performance metrics.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/` → Dataset files.
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebooks for EDA, training, and evaluation.
- `src/` → Code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `README.md` → Project overview and setup instructions.

## 🎯 Results
The **Decision Tree Regressor** emerged as the best model after fine-tuning, achieving:
- **MAE:** 0.0547
- **RMSE:** 1.9512
- **R² Score:** 0.9778
